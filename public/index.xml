      <description>Another year has passed and here we are again! Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a baby&amp;hellip; then happy first new year! You must be a genius to be reading before you&amp;rsquo;re even one.
This year I plan to make a lot of changes in my daily schedule. Writing these posts is one of them and I welcome you all to join me on my journey of learning and adventure!
What are some things you plan on in the new year?</description>
