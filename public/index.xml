      <description>You&#39;ve all heard the rumors... and yes! It&#39;s true! I now have my very own About  page.  This is the culmination of many skills I&#39;ve learned in only the past few weeks and I&#39;m excited to finally share it with all of you!  Anyways, I&#39;m going to catch up on the three nights of sleep I skipped to get this out by today. &amp;ndash;Christian Trussler</description>

      <description>Another year has passed and here we are again! Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a baby&amp;hellip; then happy first new year! You must be a genius to be reading before you&amp;rsquo;re even one.
This year I plan to make a lot of changes in my daily schedule. Writing these posts is one of them and I welcome you all to join me on my journey of learning and adventure!
What are some things you plan on in the new year?</description>
