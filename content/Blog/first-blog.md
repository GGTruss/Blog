Another year has passed and here we are again! Unless you're a baby... then happy first new year! You must be a genius to be reading before you're even one.

This year I plan to make a lot of changes in my daily schedule. Writing these posts is one of them and I welcome you all to join me on my journey of learning and adventure!

What are some things you plan on in the new year? I hope all your deadlines are met on schedule!
